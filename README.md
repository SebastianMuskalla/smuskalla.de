Deploy instructions
-------------------

This project already comes with:

* A profile picture made by strawberrymacaron_art (<https://www.instagram.com/strawberrymacaron_art/>)

* normalize.css (<https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/>)

For the missing dependencies, one has to proceed as follows:

* **Academicons**:
  * Create the folder `html/fonts/academicons`.
  * Download the latest release of Academicons from <https://github.com/jpswalsh/academicons/releases>.
  * Extract the files into `html/fonts/academicons`.

* **Font Awesome**:
  * Create the folder `html/fonts/fontawesome`.
  * Download the latest free version of Font Awesome from <https://fontawesome.com/download>.
  * The extracted file will contain a folder (e.g. `fontawesome-free-6.2.0-web`). Copy the contents of this folder into `html/fonts/fontawesome`.

* **Adobe Source Sans**:
  * We will work with the folder `html/fonts/source` that already exists and contains a `.css` file.
  * Download the latest releases for Adobe Source Sans from <https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans/releases/tag/3.052R>.\
  You will need the releases containing the OTF, the TTF, the WOFF, and the WOFF2 files.
  * Extract the `.otf` files from the OTF release (subfolder `OTF/`) into the folder `html/fonts/source`.
  * Extract the `.ttf` files from the TTF release into the folder `html/fonts/source`.
  * Extract the `.otf.woff` files from the WOFF release (subfolder `WOFF/OTF`) into the folder `html/fonts/source`.
  * Extract the `.otf.woff2` files from the WOFF2 release (subfolder `WOFF2/OTF`) into the folder `html/fonts/source`.
